Project Description: Multi-Tenant Architecture in ASP.NET Core
This project demonstrates the implementation of a multi-tenant architecture in an ASP.NET Core application. The goal of the project is to show how to handle multiple tenants within a single application while ensuring data isolation, context management, and tenant-specific behavior. The project uses various design patterns and middleware to manage tenants and their associated data.

Key Features:
Tenant Management: The application supports multiple tenants, each identified by a unique TenantId. It ensures that tenants have isolated data and operations within the application, providing a scalable approach for SaaS (Software as a Service) solutions.

Tenant Resolution Middleware: A custom middleware, TenantResolverMiddleware, is responsible for resolving the tenant for each request based on the HTTP request's headers. This middleware extracts the tenant identifier (e.g., from the "tenant" header) and sets it in the ICurrentTenantService.

Tenant Context:

The ICurrentTenantService interface and its implementation hold and manage the TenantId for the current request. This service ensures that tenant-specific data is handled consistently across various parts of the application.
The ApplicationDbContext and TenantDbContext classes are used to manage different entities in the database (e.g., Product, Tenant) and enforce tenant isolation. The ApplicationDbContext applies tenant-based filters to ensure that products are filtered by tenant, and modifies entities to automatically set the tenant ID when changes are made.
Multi-Tenant Data Isolation:

In the ApplicationDbContext, the query for Product entities is filtered by the current TenantId, ensuring that users only see and interact with data belonging to their tenant.
The SaveChanges method is overridden to ensure that when entities implementing IMustHaveTenant are modified, the correct tenant ID is applied to the entity before saving.
Seamless Tenant Interaction:

The project provides endpoints like ProductsController to interact with tenant-specific product data, demonstrating how to create, retrieve, and delete products while ensuring tenant data isolation.
Record Types for Requests: The CreateProductRequest record is used for receiving data to create a new product. It simplifies request handling and ensures that only relevant information (name and description) is passed during product creation.

Overview of Components:
Models:

Product: Represents a product belonging to a specific tenant. Implements IMustHaveTenant to ensure the product is associated with the current tenant.
Tenant: Represents the tenant entity containing the Id and Name. Each tenant has unique data in the application.
CreateProductRequest: A request model used to create a new product with name and description fields.
Services:

ICurrentTenantService: Interface responsible for getting and setting the current tenant's TenantId.
TenantResolverMiddleware: Custom middleware that reads the tenant information from the request headers and sets the current tenant's context.
Database Contexts:

ApplicationDbContext: The primary database context for managing product data. Ensures tenant isolation by applying query filters and updating entities with the correct tenant ID during modifications.
TenantDbContext: Database context used specifically for managing tenant-related data, including creating and storing tenants.
Controllers:

ProductsController: Handles HTTP requests for managing products. Demonstrates multi-tenancy by allowing tenant-specific product operations (CRUD).
Project Workflow:
When a request is made to the server, the TenantResolverMiddleware inspects the request headers to extract the tenant identifier.
The ICurrentTenantService is updated with the resolved TenantId, ensuring that the rest of the request pipeline uses the correct tenant context.
When querying the database, the ApplicationDbContext applies the tenant filter to ensure data isolation. Similarly, when saving changes, the tenant ID is automatically set for entities that require it.
The ProductsController provides endpoints to interact with the products, ensuring that operations are tenant-specific.
This project showcases how to build a multi-tenant application using ASP.NET Core, providing essential functionality to handle tenant-specific logic in a scalable and secure manner.
